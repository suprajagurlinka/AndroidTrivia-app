The complete app is a game in which the user answers three trivia questions about Android coding.
 If the user answers all three questions correctly, they win the game and can share their results. 
It makes use of the navigation component within Jetpack to move the user between screens.
Each screen is implemented as a fragment. The app navigates using buttons, the app bar, and a navigation drawer.
